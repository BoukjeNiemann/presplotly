## Plotly
This presentation gives you a few examples of what plotly can do for you

- You can dynamically zoom in on your data
- You can turn a 3D-plot around to look at it from all angles

## The mtcars dataset

```{r}
library(plotly)
mtcars$am <- factor(mtcars$am, labels = c("automatic", "manual"))
plot_ly(mtcars, x = ~wt, y = ~mpg, type = "scatter", 
        color = ~am)
```


## 3D plot of the mtcars dataset

```{r}
plot_ly(x = ~mtcars$wt, y = ~mtcars$qsec, z = ~mtcars$mpg,
        type = "scatter3d", color = ~mtcars$am)
```
